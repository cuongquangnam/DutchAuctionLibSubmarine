# Dutch Auction with Lib Submarine

This repo is cloned from https://github.com/lorenzb/libsubmarine and makes necessary changes to adapt it with Dutch Auction.

Please check out contracts/DutchAuction and contracts/CypherpunkCoin to see how we use the LibSubmarine API for the dutch auction

Also, we propose for the block in the past that blockhash function can refer to to be further for this solution to work.
